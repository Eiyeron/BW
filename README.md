# BW (Love2D)
## Postmortem code upload

I decided to publish the sources of this project abandoned for a while now. It might give some ideas
to anyone who wants to tinker it.
It should run on [Love2D][love2d] 0.10, probably not higher due to API changes.

I don't even remember why I started this project. I had a Pico-8 version that was well developped.
In the end it helped me as a sandbox project for small subprojects like the palette feature or th
event sequence system, feel free to browse in `sequence/` or `palette.lua`. I'd also suggest
looking at the textbox system, it was the cleanest and best developped iteration I had of such
textbox until I did my [Haxeflixel version][textbox].

There are a few garbage files here and there. I'll clean the repo later before archiving it, along
with adding a LICENCE file.
